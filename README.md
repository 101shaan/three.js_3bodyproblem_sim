# Three.js 3-Body Problem Simulator

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This is a simple and fun web-based simulation of the famous **3-body problem** using Three.js. It's all HTML and JavaScriptâ€”no fancy setup required!

## What is the 3-Body Problem?

It's a classic physics puzzle:  
Given three objects in space, each pulling on the others with gravity, can you predict their motion? Turns out, it's really hard! The orbits can get wild and unpredictable.

## What's in this project?

- ðŸŒŒ A cool visual simulation of three "planets" dancing around each other.
- ðŸš€ Built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D graphics in your browser.
- ðŸ“„ Just open the main HTML file and see it in actionâ€”no installs needed.

## How to use

1. **Clone or download** this repo.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Watch the 3 bodies interact!
4. (Optional) Tinker with the code to change masses, positions, or colors.

## Why?

- It's a fun way to see chaos theory in motion.
- Great for learning about orbits, gravity, and Three.js basics.
- Because simulating space stuff is awesome.
